For this project, I grabbed the IMDB Ratings of Movies from 2006-2016 from Keggle using the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data.
Visualized different sets of data such as comparing the IMDB Ratings based on the year and based on the genre of the movie.
I used pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries on Jupyter Notebook.

During this project, I followed a youtube tutorial. 
From following the tutorial, I learned how to use the Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries and practiced using Pandas. 
From the knowledge I gained from the tutorial, I made a scatterplot of the revunue the movies earned and their IMDB ratings.
I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the IMDB ratings and the revenue the movies earned.
