Grabbing the IMDB Ratings of Movies from 2006-2016 from Keggle using the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data
Visualized different sets of data such as comparing the IMDB Ratings based on the year and based on the genre of the movie.
Also, figuring out whether there is a correlation between the IMDB Rating of a movie and the revenue that movie brought in using a scatter plot. 
I used pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries on Jupyter Notebook.
