For this project, I grabbed the IMDB Ratings of Movies from 2006-2016 from Keggle using the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data.
Visualized different sets of data such as comparing the IMDB Ratings based on the year and based on the genre of the movie.
I used pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries on Jupyter Notebook.
